#Convert the EXE to Xml using itself, and then copy just the EncodedFileContents to a new 
# text document called f2x.txt.  This text can be copied to the target machine via email, 
# shared clipboard, any number of means.
#Then use the below script to turn it back into an EXE.  The created file at the very
# beginning of this process can be confirmed by using the Clipboard option from the source 
# machine to create the EXE again on the target machine (but named differently, you can't
# overwrite a file in use).
